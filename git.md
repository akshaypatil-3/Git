### What is Git 
-----------------------------------------------
> Git it is open source Distributed version control system it is three way process it contain workspace, local repository and remote repository.

>we are worked work workspace after complete work commit changes into local repository.
local repository is exect copy of remote repository which is place on local system. local repository maintain of its own version.


>For the remote repository we are used GitHub and GitLab to store the source code & it provide the centralize store.

### Why we need Git?
---------------------------------
>git tracks the changes you make files, so you have record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions
if you feel bug in current version so you can also go back to the specific verison. 

>git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.

### What makes git unique from other tools like SVN?
---
>Subversion it is open souce centralized version control system 
it is two way process it contain remote repository and working copy which is present on local system.
we work on workstation and we need to connect with remote repositoy continuously with the internet or network while working.
if centralize repository gets destroy or data loss in such case complete or single point of failure and never retry of data of server.

>but in case of git there is no need to connect every time with remote repository. we are only connected remote repository while at the time to sincup local and remote repository. if remote repository gets destroy in such case we can retrive the remote repository by local repository because local repository maintain of it own version only few amount of data loss.
